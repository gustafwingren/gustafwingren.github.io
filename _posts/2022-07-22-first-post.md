This is my first post about my journey.

## Jekyll
I have used jekyll to serve my blog, and it supports posts written in markdwon which is quite nice and easy for me to add a new post or even a page.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
