My name is Gustaf Wingren and I´m mostly a fullstack developer, with experience in C#, Java, Swift, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

I´m also a parent to two wonderfull daughters. In the time between work and family life I really like be in the kitchen and create and trying out different recipes. 

This is my personal website where I will share my thoughts about development and I plan to start a blog series where I try to create a new recipe website, with the knowledge that I have accuired through my job.
